He would see some military action in the North-West Frontier and was promoted to Corporal, he then become an instructor in 1942 and achieved the rank of Sergeant.\n\n During the chaotic British leave of India in 1943 and the collapse of Indian stability, Piru would politically side with Bose.\n\nAs the Afghan invasion of India began in 1949 he would be sent to the frontlines. He would tragically be injured in the stomach by a bullet in early 1954 and was hospitalized. He would be re-deployed to the front in late '54 but by that point Afghan victory was imminent.

 paternalism_subhasism_subtype_desc: "Forged amidst the flames of the Raj's collapse, Subhasism is, atleast to those in the Indian Subcontinent, a revolutionary ideology, one which seeks to free them from their colonial past and usher in a new era for the region.\n\nThe thought began in the mid 1900s by one Subhas Chandra Bose, a Hindi freedom fighter whose one goal was to remove the British occupiers from India, no matter the cost. His ideology took india by storm as it united both left wing and right wing resistance movements with its salad bowl like though. The Subhasist dream became a reality when an East Indian uprising occured in the early 1940s, culminating in the allied retreat from India in 1943.\n\nSubhasism reached its peak in the 1950s under the INC's coalition party, paving the way for the future of India, Southern Asia and the world."
