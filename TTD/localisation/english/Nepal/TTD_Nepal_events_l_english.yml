The mountain ranges has been at the forefront of almost all debates within the Nepalese government as groups of Tibetan explorers have begun illegally crossing the border into Nepal via Everest, an act which the Nepalese government has decried as intrusions into their rightful territory .\n\n Whilst the Nepalese government have already publicly condemned the explorers, the Kashag and the Dalai Lama has remained silent.\n\nAs a result, blanket arrests have been authorised for Tibetans without a valid point of entry, yet it is widely believed these men have long fled Nepal and Everest as a whole due to an unexpected series of storms and avalanches in the region.\n\nIt is unknown what the future holds for such a majestic piece of Earth's geography.\n"
