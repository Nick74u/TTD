  bhutan.focus_event.1.d:0 "Kanwal's eyes scanned the vast mountain range. His eyes darted to the high peaks, then to the shallow valley. Waiting wasn't his speciality. Singhs fine leather shoes eagerly tapped against the fine floorboards of the palace-like structure.\n\nAs Kanwal rearranged the cutlery and plate of apetizers on his table, preparing it to be his newest pillow, the silouette of a man had begun to form out of the corner of his gloomy eyes. The last thing Singh wished for was to be forced to talk to another high ranking official in his govermment. Kanwal's urges got the best of him and he slowly rested his head on the stiff table."

  bhutan_flavor.1.d: "The former king stood tall above the kneeling crowd. A group of around 300, gathered there in his name, chanting, smiling and pledging allegiance to his group. Flags of the Thunder Dragon flew high above the ground, waving with every gust of wind.\n\nAs Tibetan rifles were held up high the former king held his up too. As he began to tighten his grip around the weapon the crowd could only respond with one thing."

  TTD_news.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]India Embroiled in War!" 
  TTD_news.1.d: "Last week, reports had begun to flood out of the Indian Subcontinent regarding the issue and fear of an escalation of the recent border skirmish near Nepal. The Subcontinents greatest fears have been confirmed true as 100,000 troops from the Azad Hind Government have crossed over the border in the north.\n\nThe Calcutta Government's goal and reasoning is currently unknown but many in the Sphere and OFN theorize this is in direct responce with the Attack on Subhas Chandra Bose's life. Whilst the Dalai Lama has announced the creation of temporary refugee camps along their Southern borders, Afghanistan in the West, more particularly Mohammed Zhahir Shah, eye the Republic of India's Western territories, looking more eager to join ever passing day."
