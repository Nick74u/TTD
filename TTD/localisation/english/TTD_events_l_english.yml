  bhutan_focus_event.1.d:0 "Kanwal's eyes scanned the vast mountain range. His eyes darted to the high peaks, then to the shallow valley. Waiting wasn't his speciality. Singhs fine leather shoes eagerly tapped against the fine floorboards of the palace-like structure.\n\nAs Kanwal rearranged the cutlery and plate of apetizers on his table, preparing it to be his newest pillow, the silouette of a man had begun to form out of the corner of his gloomy eyes. The last thing Singh wished for was to be forced to talk to another high ranking official in his govermment. Kanwal's urges got the best of him and he slowly rested his head on the stiff table."

He uttered through his shaky teeth. Thick khaki pants encompassed the lower half of his body alongside leather boots rimmed with feathers supposedly to keep warm during the harsh Himalayan snowstorms. A beige outer garment sat comfortably over the top part of his combat uniform.\n\n"I sure didn't expect to welcome such guests from our long-term allies, especially on such short notice. What Brings you here?" The room went silent for a solid five seconds when his croaky voice finally awakened.\n\n"Makoto Matsutani, Japanese attache for South Asia." He paused to clear his throat before continuing "We seek to help the Autonomous Province of Bhutan embrace the Pan-Asianist ideals, under both Tokyo and Kolkata's orders"\n\nKanwal cracked a smile as he smirkly replied, "Your assistance is greatly apreaciated.""

The Subcontinents greatest fears have been confirmed true as 100,000 troops from the Azad Hind Government have crossed over the border in the north.\n\nThe Calcutta Government's goal and reasoning is currently unknown but many in the Sphere and OFN theorize this is in direct responce with the Attack on Subhas Chandra Bose's life. Whilst the Dalai Lama has announced the creation of temporary refugee camps along their Southern borders, Afghanistan in the West, more particularly Mohammed Zhahir Shah, eye the Republic of India's Western territories, looking more eager to join ever passing day."

  ### PAK EVENTS
  TTD_pak_news.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Siege of Peshawar"
  TTD_pak_news.1.d: "The inhabitants of the bustling city of Peshawar and the surrounding regions were awoken in the early hours of [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]th to the rattle of gunfire and explosions of artillery.\n\nIn what is being dubbed internationally as The Siege of Peshawar, Punjabi freedom fighters, along with a small number of Balochis and Pashtuns aligned with them, completed a full encirclement of the city and its neighboring regions in both the Afghan military district of Frontier Provinces and the Indian owned regions to the cities East. The conflict escalated following a miscommunication between Afghan forces, which led the Peshawar Garrison to mistakenly retreat into the city. This strategic error provided the revolutionaries with a unique opportunity to initiate a siege and immediately commence a shelling campaign aimed at civilian infrastructure and amenities, intending to weaken the morale of the populace and devastate the now trapped garrison.\n\nWith the siege already having claimed the lives of just under 10,000 civilians and 150 military personnel on both sides, international reactions have been varied. The Sphere and OFN have unequivocally condemned the targeting of civilian life and infrastructure. In contrast, the response from the Pakt and, to a lesser extent, Germany has been characterized by silence regarding the siege, with the Fuhrer vaguely hinting at potential German involvement in the conflict. Domestically, the Afghan government has declared a state of crisis following a speech by King Mohammed Shah, wherein he pledged to rescue the besieged garrison of Peshawar at any cost. The king also denounced the rebels, drawing comparisons to various terrorist organizations that plague the Iberian Union.\n\nAlthough intellectuals from both sides deem it impossible to predict the outcome of the siege with certainty, there is unanimous agreement that it will exacerbate the crisis, presenting a challenge for which neither party is adequately prepared."
  TTD_pak_news.1.a: "Think About the People!"
  TTD_pak_news.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Afghan Forces Break the Siege!"
  TTD_pak_news.2.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, Afghan forces successfully liberated Peshawar from Punjabi freedom fighters and their allies. Coordinating closely with the besieged garrison, Afghan troops launched precise counterattacks that dismantled the encirclement and restored control over key strategic points.\n\nThis breakthrough followed weeks of intense fighting and strategic planning, during which Afghan forces regrouped with the aid of Indian special forces and launched a bold offensive to relieve the trapped garrison and civilian population. Supported by air and ground reinforcements, Afghan troops engaged in fierce battles across the outskirts of Peshawar, neutralizing enemy artillery and reclaiming territory.\n\nWhile casualties were significant on both sides, Afghan military personnel and civilians bore the brunt of losses. Nevertheless, the liberation sparked widespread relief and celebration in Peshawar and the Frontier Provinces, where residents expressed gratitude for the Afghan forces' intervention after enduring prolonged hardship.\n\nInternational reactions were swift, with neighboring countries openly welcoming the development. Despite ongoing tensions, the Afghan government pledged to maintain security measures in Peshawar and support efforts to rebuild the city in the aftermath of the brutal siege.\n\nAs Afghanistan consolidates control over Peshawar, analysts are contemplating broader implications for regional security dynamics and the ongoing struggle for stability in volatile border regions. The liberation of Peshawar marks a pivotal moment in the Pakistani rebellion, likely influencing international diplomacy and security strategies in the months ahead."
