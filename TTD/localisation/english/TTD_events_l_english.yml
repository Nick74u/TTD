  bhutan.focus_event.1.d:0 "Kanwal's eyes scanned the vast mountain range. His eyes darted to the high peaks, then to the shallow valley. Waiting wasn't his speciality. Singhs fine leather shoes eagerly tapped against the fine floorboards of the palace-like structure.\n\nAs Kanwal rearranged the cutlery and plate of apetizers on his table, preparing it to be his newest pillow, the silouette of a man had begun to form out of the corner of his gloomy eyes. The last thing Singh wished for was to be forced to talk to another high ranking official in his govermment. Kanwal's urges got the best of him and he slowly rested his head on the stiff table."

  bhutan.focus_event.16.d:0 "It was yet another day in Bhutan\n\nGeneral Kanwal Singh was going through paperwork which has become his usual routine. However today, something feels odd. As he fumbled the lengthy document, he noticed a peculiar sheet of paper about the yearly expenses. While the numbers appeared impressive, he sensed something was wrong.\n\nThe report's details were vague and unorganized, and even more eyebrows were raised, considering it was coming from Ian Cardozo's branch himself. The figures seemed too good to be true, with increased production and military equipment procurement. But what caught Kanwal's attention was a tiny signature at the back, bearing the name of Ian's Deputy instead of the secretary himself! When he visited Ian's Quarter to investigate and stopped right at his front door, he noticed a painting in the hallway that should never belong there. "That bastard probably embezzled our funds!" he remarked to himself as he finally understood what is happening, and it was only a matter of time before the culprit and his sinister scheme might cause something as disastrous as an economic collapse!\n\nKanwal's years of experience had honed his instincts, and he knew that corruption bred like cancer, eating away at the very fabric of the nation. He recalled the whispered rumors of embezzlement and fraud, the unexplained absences of key officials, and the sudden influx of wealth to the soldiers stationed in the countryside. The pieces started falling into place, and Kanwal was determined to get to the bottom of this scandal. He wondered how high the corruption went and who else might be involved: everyone who worked under Cardozo, the military, or even Cardozo himself? The general's mind raced with possibilities as he pondered his next move. \n\nOne thing was certain:He would not rest until the truth was revealed and justice was served."

  bhutan_flavor.1.d: "The former king stood tall above the kneeling crowd. A group of around 300, gathered there in his name, chanting, smiling and pledging allegiance to his group. Flags of the Thunder Dragon flew high above the ground, waving with every gust of wind.\n\nAs Tibetan rifles were held up high the former king held his up too. As he began to tighten his grip around the weapon the crowd could only respond with one thing."

  TTD_news.1.d: "Last week, reports had begun to flood out of the Indian Subcontinent regarding the issue and fear of an escalation of the recent border skirmish near Nepal. The Subcontinents greatest fears have been confirmed true as 100,000 troops from the Azad Hind Government have crossed over the border in the north.\n\nThe Calcutta Government's goal and reasoning is currently unknown but many in the Sphere and OFN theorize this is in direct responce with the Attack on Subhas Chandra Bose's life. Whilst the Dalai Lama has announced the creation of temporary refugee camps along their Southern borders, Afghanistan in the West, more particularly Mohammed Zhahir Shah, eye the Republic of India's Western territories, looking more eager to join ever passing day."
