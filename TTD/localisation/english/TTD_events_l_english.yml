  bhutan.focus_event.1.d:0 "Kanwal's eyes scanned the vast mountain range. His eyes darted to the high peaks, then to the shallow valley. Waiting wasn't his speciality. Singhs fine leather shoes eagerly tapped against the fine floorboards of the palace-like structure.\n\nAs Kanwal rearranged the cutlery and plate of apetizers on his table, preparing it to be his newest pillow, the silouette of a man had begun to form out of the corner of his gloomy eyes. The last thing Singh wished for was to be forced to talk to another high ranking official in his govermment. Kanwal's urges got the best of him and he slowly rested his head on the stiff table."

  bhutan.focus_event.16.t:0 "Missing Checks, Missing Traces"
  bhutan.focus_event.16.d:0 "It was yet another day in Bhutan\n\nGeneral Kanwal Singh was going through paperwork which has become his usual routine. However today, something feels odd. As he fumbled the lengthy document, he noticed a peculiar sheet of paper about the yearly expenses. While the numbers appeared impressive, he sensed something was wrong.\n\nThe report's details were vague and unorganized, and even more eyebrows were raised, considering it was coming from Ian Cardozo's branch himself. The figures seemed too good to be true, with increased production and military equipment procurement. But what caught Kanwal's attention was a tiny signature at the back, bearing the name of Ian's Deputy instead of the secretary himself! When he visited Ian's Quarter to investigate and stopped right at his front door, he noticed a painting in the hallway that should never belong there. "That bastard probably embezzled our funds!" he remarked to himself as he finally understood what is happening, and it was only a matter of time before the culprit and his sinister scheme might cause something as disastrous as an economic collapse!\n\nKanwal's years of experience had honed his instincts, and he knew that corruption bred like cancer, eating away at the very fabric of the nation. He recalled the whispered rumors of embezzlement and fraud, the unexplained absences of key officials, and the sudden influx of wealth to the soldiers stationed in the countryside. The pieces started falling into place, and Kanwal was determined to get to the bottom of this scandal. He wondered how high the corruption went and who else might be involved: everyone who worked under Cardozo, the military, or even Cardozo himself? The general's mind raced with possibilities as he pondered his next move. \n\nOne thing was certain:He would not rest until the truth was revealed and justice was served."

  bhutan_flavor.1.d: "The former king stood tall above the kneeling crowd. A group of around 300, gathered there in his name, chanting, smiling and pledging allegiance to his group. Flags of the Thunder Dragon flew high above the ground, waving with every gust of wind.\n\nAs Tibetan rifles were held up high the former king held his up too. As he began to tighten his grip around the weapon the crowd could only respond with one thing."

  TTD_news.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]India Embroiled in War!" 
  TTD_news.1.d: "Last week, reports had begun to flood out of the Indian Subcontinent regarding the issue and fear of an escalation of the recent border skirmish near Nepal. The Subcontinents greatest fears have been confirmed true as 100,000 troops from the Azad Hind Government have crossed over the border in the north.\n\nThe Calcutta Government's goal and reasoning is currently unknown but many in the Sphere and OFN theorize this is in direct responce with the Attack on Subhas Chandra Bose's life. Whilst the Dalai Lama has announced the creation of temporary refugee camps along their Southern borders, Afghanistan in the West, more particularly Mohammed Zhahir Shah, eye the Republic of India's Western territories, looking more eager to join ever passing day."

  TTD_news.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Siege of Peshawar"
  TTD_news.8.d: "The inhabitants of the bustling city of Peshawar and the surrounding regions were awoken in the early hours of (Month) (day)th to the rattle of gunfire and explosions of artillery.\n\nIn what is being dubbed internationally as The Siege of Peshawar, Punjabi freedom fighters, along with a small number of Balochis and Pashtuns aligned with them, completed a full encirclement of the city and its neighboring regions in both the Afghan military district of Frontier Provinces and the Indian owned regions to the cities East. The conflict escalated following a miscommunication between Afghan forces, which led the Peshawar Garrison to mistakenly retreat into the city. This strategic error provided the revolutionaries with a unique opportunity to initiate a siege and immediately commence a shelling campaign aimed at civilian infrastructure and amenities, intending to weaken the morale of the populace and devastate the now trapped garrison.\n\nWith the siege already having claimed the lives of just under 10,000 civilians and 150 military personnel on both sides, international reactions have been varied. The Sphere and OFN have unequivocally condemned the targeting of civilian life and infrastructure. In contrast, the response from the Pakt and, to a lesser extent, Germany has been characterized by silence regarding the siege, with the Fuhrer vaguely hinting at potential German involvement in the conflict. Domestically, the Afghan government has declared a state of crisis following a speech by King Mohammed Shah, wherein he pledged to rescue the besieged garrison of Peshawar at any cost. The king also denounced the rebels, drawing comparisons to various terrorist organizations that plague the Iberian Union.\n\nAlthough intellectuals from both sides deem it impossible to predict the outcome of the siege with certainty, there is unanimous agreement that it will exacerbate the crisis, presenting a challenge for which neither party is adequately prepared."
  TTD_news.8.a: "Think About the People!"
  TTD_news.9.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Afghan Forces Break the Siege!"
  TTD_news.9.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, Afghan forces successfully liberated Peshawar from Punjabi freedom fighters and their allies. Coordinating closely with the besieged garrison, Afghan troops launched precise counterattacks that dismantled the encirclement and restored control over key strategic points.\n\nThis breakthrough followed weeks of intense fighting and strategic planning, during which Afghan forces regrouped with the aid of Indian special forces and launched a bold offensive to relieve the trapped garrison and civilian population. Supported by air and ground reinforcements, Afghan troops engaged in fierce battles across the outskirts of Peshawar, neutralizing enemy artillery and reclaiming territory.\n\nWhile casualties were significant on both sides, Afghan military personnel and civilians bore the brunt of losses. Nevertheless, the liberation sparked widespread relief and celebration in Peshawar and the Frontier Provinces, where residents expressed gratitude for the Afghan forces' intervention after enduring prolonged hardship.\n\nInternational reactions were swift, with neighboring countries openly welcoming the development. Despite ongoing tensions, the Afghan government pledged to maintain security measures in Peshawar and support efforts to rebuild the city in the aftermath of the brutal siege.\n\nAs Afghanistan consolidates control over Peshawar, analysts are contemplating broader implications for regional security dynamics and the ongoing struggle for stability in volatile border regions. The liberation of Peshawar marks a pivotal moment in the Pakistani rebellion, likely influencing international diplomacy and security strategies in the months ahead."
