  bhutan_focus_event.1.d:0 "Kanwal's eyes scanned the vast mountain range. His eyes darted to the high peaks, then to the shallow valley. Waiting wasn't his speciality. Singhs fine leather shoes eagerly tapped against the fine floorboards of the palace-like structure.\n\nAs Kanwal rearranged the cutlery and plate of apetizers on his table, preparing it to be his newest pillow, the silouette of a man had begun to form out of the corner of his gloomy eyes. The last thing Singh wished for was to be forced to talk to another high ranking official in his govermment. Kanwal's urges got the best of him and he slowly rested his head on the stiff table."

  bhutan_focus_event.10.d:0 "Two logistic trucks arrived at Thimphu, the desolate capital of the junta, all bearing the flag of the Rising Sun.\n\nKanwal didn't expect nor was informed that guests were coming, yet, he had to welcome them as to not damage his or Bose's image within the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nSmall clouds of smoke emerged from the frostbitten lips of one of the men.\n\n"Good day to you, Gentlemen!" he uttered through his shaky teeth. Thick khaki pants encompassed the lower half of his body alongside leather boots rimmed with feathers supposedly to stay warm, during the harsh snowstorms of the Himalayas. A beige outer garment sat comfortably over the top part of his combat uniform.\n\n"I sure didn't expect to welcome such guests on such short notice, especially from lands situated so far from home. What brings you here?" The room went silent for a solid five seconds when one man, supposedly the leader of the group's croaky voice finally awakened.\n\n"Makoto Matsutani, Japanese attaché for Hindustan's Frontier Command." He paused to clear his throat, before continuing. "We seek to help the Autonomous Province of Bhutan embrace the ideals of the sphere, and be able to resist against the Bhotamuzh, who we've been getting multiple reports about," he said.\n\nKanwal cracked a smile as he replied, "Your assistance is greatly appreciated.""

  bhutan_flavor.1.t: "A Former King"
  bhutan_flavor.1.d: "The former king stood tall above the kneeling crowd. A group of around 300, gathered there in his name, chanting, smiling and pledging allegiance to his group. Flags of the Thunder Dragon flew high above the ground, waving with every gust of wind.\n\nAs Tibetan rifles were held up high the former king held his up too. As he began to tighten his grip around the weapon the crowd could only respond with one thing."
  bhutan_flavor.1.a: "His Majesty will be back someday..."
 
  bhutan_border_skirmish.2.t: "Kolkatan Mail"
  bhutan_border_skirmish.2.d: "Dalal was in his state-issued quarters, the Central Secretariat, with some other key officials. The day was not particularly cold, which is usually a rarity in the cold lands of the Himalayas, nor was it too warm. Staying updated with news from the rest of the world was quite rare too, which wouldn't be that much of a surprise, considering the geography of the region. Nonethless, this initially-unpromising day was not a usual, boring day in Kanwal's life. Mere hours ago he received an envelope, which seemed interesting, to say the least.\n"From: Kolkata\nTo: Kanwal Singh Dalal"\n\n"Dear Kanwal, as you may know, the Government of Hindustan holds significant gratitude for our friends in Tibet, but, recent times brought upon our eyes the issue of illegitimate Tibetan occupation in Me Tog, land that is rightfully Hindustani, according to the previously-described McMahon Line. Your army is permitted to execute attacks and reclaim the territory by any means necessary, if so."\n\nKindest Regards,"

  bhutan_civil_war.1.d: ""It's time we rise up against the occupiers of our beloved country, it's time to shake off the chains on which we were imprisoned, it's time, for our beloved country to be free!" \n\nReports indicate a total collapse of order from the eastern provinces of Bhutan, the rebels have occupied some small towns and are now mobilizing their militia."

In what is being dubbed internationally as The Siege of Peshawar, Pakistani freedom fighters completed a full encirclement of the city and its neighboring regions within the Afghan military district of the Frontier Provinces.
