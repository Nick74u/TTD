  BHU_the_chained_dragon_desc: "The locals tend to think that we are occupiers, that we will enslave and persecute their people, and that we will partake in "mass murder" or "genocide".  They want us to immediately go back to where we came from. But, we are not the monsters that they think we are.\n\n We will teach them the benefits of being so closely connected to the economic powerhouses which are Azad Hind and Japan. We will teach them about the dark side of their previous rulers, the monarchs of the Wangchuck Dynasty, and how they oppressed them and blocked them from the prosperity Bhutan could've had. We will undo the wrongdoings done by the those who ruled them in the past, and shall let Bhutan enter a new, definite future, which is to embrace their newfound partners down south, and become one, with Hindustan.. Bhutan shall be reborn with a new image, a new history, and a new national identity...\n\nAnd if §Yanyone§! tries to resist, §Rthey already know what's coming for them§!"

The junta revieves a monthly convoy from the Kolkota government in order to prepare the Province of Bhutan for statehood in Azad Hind, a tedious process which requires the total elimination of Bhutanese nationalism and hope for self determination. Though Singh is supplied straight from one of the most influential nations in South Asia, him and his garrison still find themselves and most importantly their supplies being harraswed by the Bhotamuzh almost monthly as their supply convoys are required to travel through harsh Himalayan terrain.\n\nThe fate of Bhutan's integration lies not only within the choices of the junta but also that of the resistance.."
