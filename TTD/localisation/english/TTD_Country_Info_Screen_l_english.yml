  BHU_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "When the Second World War ended and with the total change of the world order, Bhutan was relatively unchanged due to its isolationist and landlocked land that they own.\n The mountains would be the natural defense of Bhutan since time immemorial, and the Druk Gyalpo knows it"

  BHU_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "When the Hindu-Afghan war resulted in a humiliating lost for the Republic of India and Subhas Chandra Bose getting all the blame for it, he then fled east with his other contemporaries collectively called the Azad Hind which is aligned to Sphere.\n\n Bhutan has a new neighbor down south and only the years following it, they will know what their attitude is towards the fledging state of Bhutan"

  BHU_CountryInfo_Content.6: "The Monarchy"
  BHU_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "Although hope is mutually lost among the populace, a small group of rebels known locally as the Bhotamuzh still fights valiently as if the 1959 invasion is still ongoing. Led by the former king of the Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the resistance group seeks to reinstate the great Kingdom of Bhutan under a Constitutional monarchy with the Wangchuck Dynasty reascending to the throne to the throne.\n\nMainly operating in the former Azad Hind controlled region of Western Arunachal, the small, yet effective militia are no strangers to terror attacks, political assasinations and raids against members of the military cabinet, acting as a major contributing factor towards Kanwal Singh Dalal's paranoia and oppressive regime.\n\nWith resistance cells spanning from Gangtok in the west to Rta Dbang in the east, the Bhotamuzh grows ever slowly, paving an uncertain future for the Military District of the Autonomous Province of Bhutan."

 NEP_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "The 1951 revolution, headed by the §RNepali Congress§!, saw the end of a §qcorrupt oligarchy§! and the beginning of a §Mfree democracy§!.\n\nThe revolution brought along with it, the beggining of a constitutional monarchy, as negotiated by the §GIndian Unity Government§!. King Tribhuvan was given power to appoint the prime inister, initially choosing Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana. Mohan's short-lived rule was followed by multiple §RCongress-Aligned§! cabinets who all hosted multi-party elections.\n\nBy the 1959 elections, disillusionment had grown. Newly appointed King Mahendra, alleging corruption within the §RNepali Congress§!, utilized his emergency powers to dissolve the government and reinstate an §eautocratic regime§! in early 1961, marking the end of Nepal's democratic career."

 NEP_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "Following the royal coup, King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev led a claimed to be §mdemocratic nation§! through a §eweb of lies§! and §edeception§!. The King's Panchayat system catagorized §BN§!§Re§!§sp§!§Ra§!§Bl§! as a constitutional monarchy, yet, to anyone within the government, the kingdom was as far from a §mdemocracy§! as the §oGerman Reich§! was a §mrepublic§!.\n\nIntroduced in a less authoritarian version in 1955, the Panchayat system emerged as a cornerstone within King Mahendra's policiies. The Panchayats used local repressentitive 'elections' which on the surface looked to be legitimate but were really used as politcal playgrounds for aristocrats and politicians to gain influence. After the coup in 1960, the policy ramped up its corruption, paralysing Nepal's political progression and leaving an unaware populace §eunder the leash§! of a §edeceptive kingdom.§!"
