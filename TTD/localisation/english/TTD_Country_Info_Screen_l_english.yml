  BHU_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "Although hope is mutually lost among the populace, a small group of rebels known locally as the Tantangyigogrgolbyas still fights valiently as if the 1956 invasion is still ongoing. Led by the former king of the Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the resistance group seeks to reinstate the great Kingdom of Bhutan under a Constitutional monarchy with the Wangchuck Dynasty reascending to the throne to the throne.\n\nMainly operating in the former Azad Hind controlled region of Western Arunachal, the small, yet effective militia are no strangers to terror attacks, political assasinations and raids against members of the military cabinet, acting as a major contributing factor towards Kanwal Singh Dalal's paranoia and oppressive regime.\n\nWith resistance cells spanning from Gangtok in the west to Rta Dbang in the east, the Tantangyigogrgolbyas grows ever slowly, paving an uncertain future for the Military District of the Autonomous Province of Bhutan."
