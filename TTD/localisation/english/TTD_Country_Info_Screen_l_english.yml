  BHU_CountryInfo_Content.6: "The Monarchy"
  BHU_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "Although hope is mutually lost among the populace, a small group of rebels known locally as the Bhotamuzh still fights valiently as if the 1959 invasion is still ongoing. Led by the former king of the Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the resistance group seeks to reinstate the great Kingdom of Bhutan under a Constitutional monarchy with the Wangchuck Dynasty reascending to the throne to the throne.\n\nMainly operating in the former Azad Hind controlled region of Western Arunachal, the small, yet effective militia are no strangers to terror attacks, political assasinations and raids against members of the military cabinet, acting as a major contributing factor towards Kanwal Singh Dalal's paranoia and oppressive regime.\n\nWith resistance cells spanning from Gangtok in the west to Rta Dbang in the east, the Bhotamuzh grows ever slowly, paving an uncertain future for the Military District of the Autonomous Province of Bhutan."

 NEP_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "The 1951 revolution, headed by the Nepali Congress, marked the end of dictatorship and the beginning of democracy in Nepal.\n\nThe movement marked the end of the Rana oligarchy and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy under the Delhi Accords, negotiated by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. King Tribhuvan retained his status as Head of State and was given power to appoint the Prime Minister, initially choosing Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana. Mohan served until November 1951, when he was succeeded by MP Koirala and an interim government.\n\nWith the declaration of the republic, Nepal prepared to conduct multi-party elections, which, for the first time in Nepal's history would allow citizens to choose their leader. Over the next eight years, successive ministerial cabinets were formed. However, by the 1959 elections, disillusionment had grown. King Mahendra, alleging corruption within the Nepali Congress, utilized his emergency powers to dissolve the government and reinstate an autocratic regime in early 1961."
