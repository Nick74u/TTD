### Leader Descs ###
 POLITICS_BP_KOIRALA_DESC: "Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, the first democratically elected president of Nepal. The only man who can say truly he is the sovereign leader of Nepal. Born in 1914 during his family's exile in Bihar, India, Koirala's early thoughts and political views were shaped mainly by his father's involvement in India's independence movement, molding his view on social rights from a young age.\n\nReturning to Nepal in the late 1930s after his education in India, Koirala co-founded the Nēpālī Kāngrēsa (Nepali Congress) in 1946 alongside his 2 Brothers and a member of the Rana family living in exile in Calcutta. This proved a pivotal moment in Nepal's path toward liberalism. Koirala's advocacy for more western and liberal principles led to imprisonment by the corrupt Rana oligarchy in 1947, though he was released following Nepal's 1951 uprising against the same government which had imprisoned him.\n\nIn his first election in 1959, Koirala became easily the most favoured candidate since he championed democracy, equality and modernization. He also gained international respect due to his pro western and OFN views despite being a country in Asia. His tenure was cut short in 1960 when King Mahendra staged a royal coup d'état, halting democratic progress and gaining progress toward imprisoning Koirala alongside other leaders.\n\nThroughout, Koirala's literary contributions, including novels like "Sumnima" and "Tin Ghumti,", he reflected his deep rooted understanding and love for Nepali society yep also acknowledging its need for reform. As of now, his legacy stands as a beacon of hope for Nepal's continued journey towards democratization and social justice, inspiring those within the Nepali populace to support him in his strive for freedom and equity."
 POLITICS_TP_ACHARYA_DESC: "Born to 2 loving parents in 1912, Tanka Prasad Acharya, commonly known as 'T.P. Acharya' is a man of the people, one which strived for liberalism and freedom amongst the gloomy streets of Kathmandu and Nepal, one which dreamed of a Nepal united against its greatest foe in his eyes, monarchism.\n\nT.P. Acharya began his political journey in a desolate hotel in Bhimphedi, a rural village located in Nepal's Makwanpur District. It was there where he met one of the 4 renowner 'Martyrs' of Nepal, Dashrath Chand, Acharya and Chand would go on to form the Nepal Peoples Party in 1936, embracing liberalism and freedom as their core principles. Through a strange link of friendships, the NPP got explicit support by the then King of Nepal, Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah Dev. The group excelled at combatting Rana forces but not by military means, rather propaganda and the population. Acharya was labeled as the Head of Propaganda in the party and somewhere down that same road, He managed to import a printing machine from the then British Raj. Throughout the 1940s, Acharya and the NPP began to radicalize and eventually planned an assasination of many high-ranking figures of the Rana government. It was this same plot which would get him arrested and placed on the Nepali version of death row. Acharya was saved by the then Nepali law which forbid the killing of Brahims, a social class within the Hindu faith which Acharya was a part of. This allowed Acharya to get off with only life in prison.\n\nDuring the 1951 revolution against the Ranas, Acharya was freed from prison and elected President of Nepal in 1956 and served until he was succeded by K.I Singh the following year.\n\nAs with every democratically elected leader of Nepal, Acharya's dream of freedom was crushed in the 1961 Coup by King Mahendra. Though Acharya did not serve as PM for long, his influence is seen far and wide within the young Kingdom of Nepal as him and his NPP have risen the ranks to one of the most popular parties in Nepal." 
 POLITICS_KESHAR_RAYAMAJHI_DESC: "Known far and wide throughout South Asia, Keshar Jung Rayamajhi is a martyr of flexibility and openness when expressing ones beliefs and thoughts. Born into a Chetri family in Tansen, Nepal, Rayamajhi was from a young age somewhat interested in political affairs. He despised the Rana oligarchy and their despotic grasp on Nepal which led him down a path of affiliation with Leftist groups and organizations within Nepal and beyond. moving to Kolkata in 1945 after the end of the Second World War, Rayamajhi familiarised himself with members of the CPI (Communist Party of India), allowing him to contact other Nepalese marxists living in exile, summiting in the formation of the 'Nepalese Marxist Study Circle' which was later rebranded to the 'Nepali Progressive Study Circle' due to influence from the Nepali Congress and other plotters of the 1951 revolution.\n\nMoving back to Nepal in 1952, Rayamajhi attended the first NKP (Nepal Communist Party) congress, in which he was elected to central committee of the party. In 1956 Rayamajhi's close associate Manmohan Adhikari travelled to Delhi and Kolkata respectively in order to affirm both India's support for the NKP. In 1967, Rayamajhi would attend the 2nd congress of the NKP, in which, he would advocate for supporting a Constitutional monarchy under the Shah dynasty. Rayamajhi was subsiquently accused of being an informant for the royal palace.\n\nRayamjhi and his wing of the NKP still serve as formidable opponents for all other parties in Nepal including the royal palace which he was accused of supporting."

 NEP_Dictatorship_With_the_Face_of_Democracy: "Illusion of Democracy"
 NEP_Dictatorship_With_the_Face_of_Democracy_desc: "Since the 1961 coup, Nepal's Panchayat system has been known to hold regular elections, however, unbeknownst to almost everybody outside of the government, these elections are corrupt playgrounds for high level politicians and members of the royal family to gain influence and presitge within the government. Nepal's political corruption stends further than anyone could imagine as the 'elections' are directly ordered by the king himself.\n\nNepal's 'democratic' elections began after the coup as a promise directly to Azad Hind and the Republic of India, two nations who both supplied the Congress in the 1951 revoution. Nepal now meticulously runs these corrupt elections, something which both Indian governments are unaware of. Despite this illusion of democracy, Nepal's populace are beggining to sow the seeds for a democratic future through the thoughts of political pluralism and freedom. A future where every Nepali may live in peace and harmony under a truly democratic regime."

Since the end of 1961, the Congress have mostly retreated from the streets with the current protests being a meer shadow of what they used to be.\n\nMany high ups within the King's government debate what the current intentions of the Congress are,\n\nbut those amongst the §Rrebellious populace§! are sure to know their §Rtrue intentions...§!"

 NEP_Second_Sat_Salko_Kranti_desc: "The echoes of the 1951 uprising against the Rana regime still linger, but this time, the hatred is being channeled towards is the Shah monarchy. Years of dissatisfaction with royal rule, marked by nepotism and neglect, have fuelled a growing movement of anti monarchists, all with one main goal, the dissolution of the Kingdom. The authoritarian regime responds with repression, but for every arrest, public execution or disappearance, three more join the cause. \n\nAs the Kingdom teeters on the edge of change, the outcome lies in the hands of the people. The streets of Kathmandu reverberate with the chants of protesters, their voices echoing the collective yearning for freedom and justice. Despite the Raja's attempts to quash dissent, the flame of resistance burns brighter with each act of brutality, igniting hope in the hearts of the oppressed."
