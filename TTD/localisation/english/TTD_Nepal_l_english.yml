  NEP_Dictatorship_With_the_Face_of_Democracy: "A Dictatorship with the Face of a Democracy"
  NEP_Dictatorship_With_the_Face_of_Democracy_desc: "In the dawn of the 1960s, the grand Kingdom of Nepal grappeled with a political paradox, epitomizing a dictatorship veiled in the trappings of democracy. Under the reign of King Mahendra, who ascended the throne in 1955, the Panchayat system emerged as the cornerstone of governance, ostensibly embracing democratic principles while consolidating power within the monarchy's grasp.\n\nOn the surface, the Panchayat system featured periodic elections and a semblance of political participation. However, true opposition was stifled, dissent crushed, and the monarch's authority remained unchallenged. Political parties were outlawed, and dissential voices were swiftly silenced, perpetuating a facade of democratic governance while tightening the grip of authoritarian rule.\n\nBeneath this veneer of false democracy, the spirit of genuine political pluralism  struggled to survive. Despite the oppressive political climate, those who still yearn for true democracy and an end to the royal tyranny will not stop until their dream becomes a reality."

Despite King Mahendra's efforts to quell the riots in late 1961, the Nepali Congress simply will not stop until they are the ones under control of the nation. Since the end of 1961, the Congress have mostly retreated from the streets with the current protests being a meer shadow of what they used to be.\n\nMany high ups within the King's government debate what the current intentions of the Congress are,\n\nbut those amongst the §Rdissidential populace§! are sure to know their §Rtrue intentions...§!"
