### Leader Descs ###
POLITICS_BP_KOIRALA_DESC: "Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, the first democratically elected president of Nepal. The only man who can say truly he is the sovereign leader of Nepal. Born in 1914 during his family's exile in Bihar, India, Koirala's early thoughts and political views were shaped mainly by his father's involvement in India's independence movement, molding his view on social rights from a young age.\n\nReturning to Nepal in the late 1930s after his education in India, Koirala co-founded the Nēpālī Kāngrēsa (Nepali Congress) in 1946 alongside his 2 Brothers and a member of the Rana family living in exile in Calcutta. This proved a pivotal moment in Nepal's path toward liberalism. Koirala's advocacy for more western and liberal principles led to imprisonment by the corrupt Rana oligarchy in 1947, though he was released following Nepal's 1951 uprising against the same government which had imprisoned him.\n\nIn his first election in 1959, Koirala became easily the most favoured candidate since he championed democracy, equality and modernization. He also gained international respect due to his pro western and OFN views despite being a country in Asia. His tenure was cut short in 1960 when King Mahendra staged a royal coup d'état, halting democratic progress and gaining progress toward imprisoning Koirala alongside other leaders.\n\nThroughout, Koirala's literary contributions, including novels like "Sumnima" and "Tin Ghumti,", he reflected his deep rooted understanding and love for Nepali society yep also acknowledging its need for reform. As of now, his legacy stands as a beacon of hope for Nepal's continued journey towards democratization and social justice, inspiring those within the Nepali populace and also those around him who live in secret within the Kingdom of Nepal."

 NEP_Dictatorship_With_the_Face_of_Democracy: "A Façade of Democracy"
 NEP_Dictatorship_With_the_Face_of_Democracy_desc: "In the dawn of the 1960s, the Nepalese Kingdom struggled with a political paradox, it's unrighteous autocratic government supporting a royal dictatorship under the reign of King Mahendra, who ascended the throne in 1955. Mahendra's Panchayat system emerged as the cornerstone of governance, meticulously embracing democratic principles whilst consolidating power within the monarchy's grasp.\n\nOn the surface, the Panchayat system featured periodic elections and a semblance of political participation. However, true opposition was stifled, dissent crushed, and the monarch's authority remained unchallenged. Political parties were outlawed, and voices of dissident were swiftly silenced, demonstrating a facade of democratic governance while tightening the grip of authoritarian rule, one which was almost completely hidden from the public eye.\n\nBeneath this veneer of false democracy, the spirit of genuine political pluralism  struggled to survive. Despite the oppressive political climate, those who still strive for true democracy and an end to the royal tyranny will not stop until their dream becomes a reality, one which will unite all of §BN§!§Re§!§Gp§!§Ra§!§Bl§!."
 NEP_Congressional_riots: "Congressional Riots"
 NEP_Congressional_riots_desc: "Following the royal coup in 1961 and the dissolution of the Nepali multiparty system, the leftists, who call themselves the Nepali Congress have been rioting and mobbing the streets of Kathmandu and other major cities. Despite King Mahendra's efforts to quell the riots in late 1961, the Nepali Congress simply will not stop until they are the ones under control of the nation. Since the end of 1961, the Congress have mostly retreated from the streets with the current protests being a meer shadow of what they used to be.\n\nMany high ups within the King's government debate what the current intentions of the Congress are,\n\nbut those amongst the §Rdissidential populace§! are sure to know their §Rtrue intentions...§!"

 NEP_Second_Sat_Salko_Kranti: "A Second Kranti?"
 NEP_Second_Sat_Salko_Kranti_desc: "The echoes of the 1951 uprising against the Rana regime still linger, but this time, the target is the Shah monarchy. Years of dissatisfaction with royal rule, marked by nepotism and neglect, have fuelled a growing movement of anti monarchists, all with one main goal, the dissolution of the Kingdom.  The authoritarian regime responds with repression, but for every arrest, public execution or disappearance, three more join the cause. \n\nAs the Kingdom teeters on the edge of change, the outcome lies in the hands of the people. The streets of Kathmandu reverberate with the chants of protesters, their voices echoing the collective yearning for freedom and justice. Despite the Raja's attempts to quash dissent, the flame of resistance burns brighter with each act of brutality, igniting hope in the hearts of the oppressed."

It was a question which rang through the minds of the leftist protesters on that fateful evening.\n\nAs members of the Nepali Congress and those which rallied their support behind them gathered to the streets in an anti-authoritarian protest, a group of police officers armed with rifles and high grade military armour patrolled down the street in a routinely manner. A protester, acting out of his own will, not those around him began to irritate the police, spit and swear words flew through the air, both sides engaging in the battle of vocabulary. Yet when the guns were pulled and the crowds began to flee, it was not just him who was gunned down.\n\n§RThe gasoline has been poured and the match has been lit...§!"
