 # Notes
 
 # [GetSLName] is a scripted loc used to get custom names, for example, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macaw's name is called "The Three Pearls" instead of the usual state name it's parented in, located in TNO_state_lore_misc_scripted_localisation.txt
 
 # INITIALS are preferably airport codes: for example LAX as Los Angeles, but not when it doesn't make sense, i.e. OPO as Porto. I chose to use POR in that case.
